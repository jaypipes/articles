## How do **you** think about the open source community?

Over the last fifteen years, I've had the privileged of working for a number of
companies that have participated in the open source software community.

Some of those companies built businesses around open source technology. Others
viewed participation in open source development as critical to their business
success. Some attempted to use the open source ecosystem for their own gain
without understanding the ramifications of certain actions. Some of those
companies meant well and worried about how business decisions impacting their
engagement with the open source community would affect them in the long run;
others didn't care about decisions as long as short-term objectives were met.

Instead of going over all of these discussion points again, instead I offer
here some advice to companies who are considering open source business and
development initiatives. Having been a community relations manager at MySQL
during the times of the [MySQL Community/Enterprise differentiation](http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2007/08/08/refining-mysql-community-server/) [debacle](http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2007/08/12/what-would-make-me-buy-mysql-enterprise/")
I have some insight into open source business initiatives and how good-meaning
people can screw up a community's respect for a company.

Here is some advice for folks at companies pondering open source initiatives,
companies trying to decide whether to close-source some previously open-source
code or adopt an "open core" business model, and some insights on what types of
software fit the open source community best.

### **Do** get into open source for software development reasons.

The open source developer movement has attempted to show that open source
development principles and methodologies are **a better way to create software**.

Some of the things that have defined (much of) the open source developer
movement have been transparency of roadmaps, transparency of decision-making,
contributor and community-driven software development, re-use of source code
and libraries, and collaboration between software projects.

So, you should get into open source **because you want to create better
software**.  Hire people who understand open source development methodologies,
community and collaborative development, and developing software that is
**packageable and modular**.

In other words, it is your **technical management** which should provide the
impetus for moving to an open-source model because your technical management
sees that it can improve the quality of its raw product by using open source
development principles.

### Open source is **not** about business development, sales or marketing

If you are a salesperson, a CEO, a marketing executive, and/or business
development manager, the sooner you understand and embrace the above statement,
the more successful your company will be in making money in the open source
world.

Why?  Because **open source is fundamentally about software development and the
freedom to develop and modify other people's software.**  It's not about sales,
marketing, or business partnerships. Those things can come later, after seeing
point #7.

If the *term* "open source" is used by your company merely to make your company
seem community-friendly or to make your company look as if it embraces open
source development before it has actually done so, the community will see
through this quickly and you may not have the time to counteract the bad
publicity.

### *Do* understand what your "community" is

Many companies that are "open source" treat the community as a mixture of the
following:

* a giant pool of [guerilla marketeers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_marketing")
* a giant pool of upsell potentials
* strategic and business partner companies
* free "code laborers" for testing and quality assurance
* freeloader

Unfortunately, many companies neither understand what the community is, nor do
they understand the value a community supplies to a company.

Your community is composed of:

* **Users** of your free (as in beer) software products
* **Developers** who wish to modify your free (as in freedom) software products
* **Advocates** who love some features of your software products
* **Haters** who despise some of your software products and actively advocate
  for your competitors products

Too few companies view their community as the soil in which to plant the seeds
of collaboration.  It is collaboration that shrinks the gap between user and
creator.  It is collaboration that makes a software product a joint effort and
changes the dynamics between the traditional consumer and producer, giving
consumers a bigger stake in the product that they use.

The bigger the collaborative ability, the more the community's stake in a
product becomes, and the more likely it will be that the product of a company
will be effectively shaped by the input of its users.  Without the community,
software products simply live in a vacuum.  It is important for individuals
contemplating an open source initiative to understand this fact, and its
importance to their company's success.

The values that your company gets from your open source community are:

* **Trust**
* **Feedback** and **criticism**
* Calls for **open standards**
* **Organic** ecosystem growth

#### Trust

Like recommendations from prior clients enable a plumber to grow his business,
so does your community provide a blanket of trust that newcomers to your
products will use when deciding whether to try your products

#### Feedback and criticism

No product is perfect. Companies that ignore their community's criticism,
especially from the "vocal minority", will find a smaller and smaller market
for their products as parts of the community will drift to competitors --
even competitors with inferior products.  If a community doesn't feel a company
listens to their criticism, they will jump ship for a more attentive ear

#### Calls for open standards

Especially in the open source world, communities push for open standards.
Because open source is about freedom from lock-in, open standards are an
important common push in open source communities.  Having your products support
more open standards is good for your reputation and wins the hearts of
companies tired of vendors pushing a single format or standard.  See [IBM's decision to switch to Firefox](http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/07/ibm-embraces-firefox-adopts-it-internally.ars)
in part because of its continuing support of open standards.

#### Organic ecosystem growth

In contrast to the kind of forced, fake "communities" that closed source
development houses create for developers, open source developer communities
tend to naturally construct ecosystems that have no distinct boundaries between
related products.  Compare Microsoft's or Oracle's developer networks with the
developer communities for PHP and MySQL. You will notice that the open source
communities have blurred boundaries between themselves.

More "mashup" technologies tend to emerge, since open source is partly about
collaboration between groups. PHP meetups regularly have MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Linux, Ruby, and Python meetup members join and vice versa. This rarely
happens in the kinds of communities pushed by closed-source vendors unless you
are talking about forced relationships between two companies' partner programs.

### **Do** treat your paying customers specially

Just because I don't view partner companies and paying customers as part of the
"community" does not mean I don't value these entities. Far from it.

As someone pondering an open source initiative at your company, you should
understand that **your community will rarely, if ever, pay for your software**.
Members of your ecosystem that *do* provide monetary value should have a
different relationship with your company.

What I believe strongly is that paying customers and strategic partner
companies should hold a special place for an "open source company".

### **Don't** pretend you are something you aren't

Honesty and transparency are always your best bet. Dishonest marketing or
sales tactics never work out in the long run and end up doing more harm than
good, especially to open source companies. Why especially to open source
companies? Because people *expect* Oracle to be misleading, overly zealous on
sales tactics, and downright anti-competitive when it comes to monetizing
products.

For good or bad, people don't *expect* open source companies to do the same,
and hold them to a higher standard. That's just the way it is. Deal with it.

The best thing a company can do that wants to make lots of money and also use
open source is to embrace open source development principles and be transparent
and honest about the extent to which the company.

### **Do** understand that you will piss someone off eventually -- and that's fine

### **Do** embrace the sanitizing effect open sourcing code brings

### **Don't** let your lawyers try to find work for themselves

Use one of the long-established open source licenses. **Do not make some
pointless change to an existing license and call it *Your Company* Open Source
License**. Ditto for contributor agreements and existing legal standards. There
has now been more than 25 years of legal precedence following the major open
source licenses. The worst thing to waste time on is creating a new license for
your product or trying to be legally fancy.

It's not worth the effort.

Pick the open source license that best meets your core objectives for
participating in open source. If that objective is to create better code,
either copyleft or non-copyleft licenses will work fine.

If your objective for participating in open source is not to create better
code, see point #1. A license does not a business model make.

### **Don't** market to the community

### **Do** market to your customers

## So, are You FLOSSploiting?

OK, so if you've made it this far, you might be wondering about the title of
this post. What is **FLOSSploitation**?  It's a term I made up to
describe the way that some companies **treat open source and the open
source community**.

There are two kinds of companies out there: companies that practice open source
and companies who don't.

In this article I've laid out my opinion on what I feel practicing open source
is all about.  FLOSSploitation is when companies produce and/or sell open
source software without understanding FLOSS and without giving the open source
community the respect it deserves.

You decide whether your company is exploiting FLOSS. If it is, change your
company from within.
